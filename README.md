An international Statistician with 7+ years working with Business Intelligence and Data Analysis.

I’m a big believer that when data, BI and BA are combined, it becomes possible to generate insights that support data-driven companies and enable a fast-growing business.

- Automated approximately +70% of finance tasks in 2 months;
- Saved 25% of total time in a daily activity of the Customer Success team by providing information with interactive dashboards, effective visualizations, and automated updates.

💻 Projects I have worked on recently:
- Structured 5+ new databases closely with the development and data engineering teams;
- Structured the processes of stock control for 3.000+ customers in collaboration with the manufacturing team;
- ETL projects that integrate 6 data sources into the data warehouse.
